API CHANGES & JUSTIFICATION

Some changes have been made to the API since the completion of the basic sprint, 
with the finished API being very different from the one created in the plan phase.
The key differences are the introduction of new methods into the Game class, in order
to improve the flexibility of design as well as add new features to the game. Examples 
of these additional features come from the powerups that have been made for other potential
game variants, different methods of moving ghosts, and improved pathfinding for ghosts.
On the front end side, there are not significant changes to the API, with only minor changes 
for new game pieces which correspond to the new powerups that had been implemented in
the backend.
