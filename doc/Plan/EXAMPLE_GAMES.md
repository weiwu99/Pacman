###EXAMPLE GAMES

##Game Type 1

Our first game type that we will implement is classic Pacman. This version aligns with the funcitonality of normal Pacman. This includes navigating a grid with energy dots, avoiding ghosts, levels that progress in difficulty, and pickups (cherry, big dot that makes ghosts edible etc.).

We chose to implement the classic version of the game for a implementation because it would be fun to see how similar and comparable to make it to the original in a short amount of time.

##Game Type 2

Our second game type will be anti-Pacman. In anti-Pacman you play as the ghost (only one) and you chase the Pacman which tries to avoid you. This introduces a difficult design problem because both the ghost and the pacman have to be playable by the user and computer.

We chose to implement this version of the game because it introduces an interesting twist to how we will define the superclass creature and how we will make both playable by the user. One of the main differences is that the cpu will need to be able to both chase and run from the user.

##Game Type 3

Our third game type will be powered up Pacman. This will introduce many more pickups that the user can collect that give Pacman special abilities. Potentially, these will allow the Pacman to move through walls, move faster, and shoot the ghosts. 

##Last Game Type

There will also be a mrs Pacman mode which just adjusts how the Pacman is display. It may simply add a bow to Pacman's character.
